# Color Cards

## Description
Add color cards to your figma designs. This allows you to build a pallete or showcase colors for inspiration. You can generate custom names using "The Color API" for easily adding your new colors to your library.

## How to Use
Add a name for your card in the "Color Name" text box. Next, click on the color box to select a color or enter in a hex color code in the box next to it. 

**Note** : The Hex code must include the hash `#` at the beginning and must have six characters following the hash.  The input is case insensitive. So, both uppercase and lowercase letters are valid to be used. An invalid input will cause the card to not be generated.

Ex : 

```
// Valid Inputs
#adc3ec
#ADC3EC 

//Invalid Inputs
#fff
e9dfea
#00000
```

If you check the "Use Color API?" box, a custom name will be pulled from the color API. **This will overwrite the name in the "Color Name" input**.
